# Development Roadmap

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a collection of TypeScript utilities designed to interact with OpenAI APIs. It provides tools for chat completions, image generation, demographic data simulation, and Steam library analysis. The primary goal is to create a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for developers and researchers to experiment with and build upon AI-powered features.

### 1.1. Project Goals

- **Extensibility**: Design a modular architecture that allows for easy integration of new AI models and services.
- **Usability**: Provide clear documentation and simple interfaces for each module.
- **Performance**: Optimize API interactions for speed and cost-efficiency.
- **Innovation**: Explore novel applications of AI in creative and analytical domains.

### 1.2. Scope

The project scope includes the following modules:

- **Chat Module**: For building and managing conversational AI.
- **Pictures Module**: For generating images with DALL-E.
- **Demographics Module**: For simulating and visualizing population data.
- **Steam Module**: For analyzing gaming data from the Steam platform.

## 2. Development Phases

The development will be organized into the following phases:

- **Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** (Q4 2025)
- **Phase 2: Beta** (Q1 2026)
- **Phase 3: Version 1.0** (Q2 2026)
- **Phase 4: Future Enhancements** (Ongoing)
