    "prompt": "The Moonlit Citadel, envision a magnificent castle perched atop a cliff, overlooking a turbulent sea. The scene is illuminated by the soft glow of the moonlight. The castle's architecture should be grand and imposing, with tall towers, arched windows, and intricate details. The moon should take center stage in the composition, radiating a gentle light that casts long shadows and adds an ethereal quality to the surroundings. The moonlight should be depicted as shimmering on the crashing waves, creating a captivating play of light and dark.To capture the spooky atmosphere, infuse the scene with a touch of mystery. Perhaps include a thin layer of fog rolling across the landscape or add a touch of surrealism to the castle's appearance, hinting at a slightly fantastical realm. This approach should evoke the magical ambiance often found in Studio Ghibli films. The overall mood of the image should be serene yet haunting, intriguing the viewer and inviting them to explore the mysteries residing within the Moonlit Citadel.Font: Choose a bold, elegant font that complements the majestic nature of the castle and the ethereal atmosphere. Suggested colors include shades of pale blue or silver, such as D8E6F3 or A8B8C7, or deep, mysterious colors like midnight blue or navy, such as 1D3557 or 131E3A. Remember, the primary goal is to create a visually stunning image that encapsulates the magical nature of Studio Ghibli while capturing the spooky ambiance of the moonlit castle by the sea.",
