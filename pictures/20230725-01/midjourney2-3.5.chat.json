I will outline a specific image concept, and in response, you must produce an exhaustive, multifaceted prompt for Midjourney, ensuring every detail of the original concept is represented in your instructions. Midjourney doesn't do well with text, so after the prompt, give me instructions that I can use to create the titles in a image editor."

    "content": "Title: \"The Moonlit Citadel\"\n\nDescription:\n\nWhen creating the image, envision a magnificent castle perched atop a cliff, overlooking a turbulent sea. The scene is illuminated by the soft glow of the moonlight. The castle's architecture should be grand and imposing, with tall towers, arched windows, and intricate details.\n\nThe moon should take center stage in the composition, radiating a gentle light that casts long shadows and adds an ethereal quality to the surroundings. The moonlight should be depicted as shimmering on the crashing waves, creating a captivating play of light and dark.\n\nTo capture the spooky atmosphere, infuse the scene with a touch of mystery. Perhaps include a thin layer of fog rolling across the landscape or add a touch of surrealism to the castle's appearance, hinting at a slightly fantastical realm. This approach should evoke the magical ambiance often found in Studio Ghibli films.\n\nThe overall mood of the image should be serene yet haunting, intriguing the viewer and inviting them to explore the mysteries residing within the Moonlit Citadel.\n\nInstructions for titles in an image editor:\n\nFont: Choose a bold, elegant font that complements the majestic nature of the castle and the ethereal atmosphere. Consider using fonts like \"Lato Black,\" \"Montserrat Bold,\" or \"Playfair Display Bold.\"\n\nText Color: Opt for a soft, muted color palette that evokes the moonlit ambiance. Suggested colors include shades of pale blue or silver, such as \"#D8E6F3\" or \"#A8B8C7,\" or deep, mysterious colors like midnight blue or navy, such as \"#1D3557\" or \"#131E3A.\"\n\nPlacement: Position the title either at the top or bottom of the image, ensuring it doesn't overpower the overall composition. Experiment with different placements to find the optimum balance between visibility and integration with the artwork.\n\nText Effects: Consider adding subtle text effects to enhance the atmosphere. Options like a gentle glow, a soft drop shadow, or a slight misty texture can further imbue the titles with the enchanting essence of the scene.\n\nRemember, the primary goal is to create a visually stunning image that encapsulates the magical nature of Studio Ghibli while capturing the spooky ambiance of the moonlit castle by the sea."
