# Feature Proposal: Full-Text Search

## 1. Introduction

This document proposes the implementation of a full-text search feature to improve data discoverability within the project. As the number of chat logs and other data files grows, it will become increasingly difficult to find specific information. A full-text search feature would allow users to quickly and easily search across all data files.

## 2. Problem Statement

The project currently stores data in a variety of formats, including JSON files for chat logs and demographic data. There is no easy way to search for specific text across all of these files. This makes it difficult to find information that is buried in a large number of files.

## 3. Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is to implement a full-text search feature that allows users to search for text across all data files in the project. This could be implemented using a library such as Lunr.js or by integrating with a search engine such as Elasticsearch.

The search feature would be exposed through the interactive web dashboard proposed in a separate document. Users would be able to enter a search query and view a list of matching results, with links to the relevant files.

## 4. Benefits

*   **Improved Data Discoverability:** A full-text search feature would make it much easier to find specific information within the project's data files.
*   **Increased Productivity:** Users would be able to find the information they need more quickly, which would increase their productivity.
*   **Enhanced User Experience:** A search feature would be a valuable addition to the interactive web dashboard and would enhance the overall user experience.

## 5. Implementation Details

The implementation would involve the following steps:

1.  **Choose a search library or engine:** Evaluate the options and choose the best fit for the project.
2.  **Index the data:** Create a search index of all the data files in the project. This would need to be updated whenever a file is created or modified.
3.  **Implement the search interface:** Create a search interface in the interactive web dashboard that allows users to enter search queries and view the results.
4.  **Integrate the search feature:** Connect the search interface to the search index and display the results to the user.
