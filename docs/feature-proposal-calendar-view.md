# Feature Proposal: Calendar View

## 1. Introduction

This document proposes the development of a calendar view for the intuitive management of events within the project. This feature would be particularly useful for visualizing chat sessions, which are time-based, but could also be used for other time-series data.

## 2. Problem Statement

The project currently stores chat sessions as a series of messages in JSON files. While this is a flexible and robust way to store the data, it is not an intuitive way to visualize the history of a conversation. A calendar view would provide a more natural way to browse and manage chat sessions.

## 3. Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is to create a calendar view in the interactive web dashboard. The calendar would display chat sessions as events, with the date of the event corresponding to the date of the chat session. Users would be able to click on an event to view the full chat log.

The calendar view could also be used to visualize other time-based data, such as the dates on which images were generated or the dates of demographic simulations.

## 4. Benefits

*   **Intuitive Event Management:** A calendar view would provide a more intuitive way to manage and browse time-based data.
*   **Improved Visualization:** A calendar view would provide a more effective way to visualize the history of chat sessions and other time-based data.
*   **Enhanced User Experience:** A calendar view would be a valuable addition to the interactive web dashboard and would enhance the overall user experience.

## 5. Implementation Details

The calendar view could be implemented using a JavaScript library such as FullCalendar or by building a custom calendar component. The data for the calendar would be sourced from the existing data files in the project. The backend would need to be updated to provide an API for querying the data in a format that can be easily consumed by the calendar component.
