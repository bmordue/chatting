# Feature Proposal: Interactive Web Dashboard

## 1. Introduction

This document proposes the development of an interactive web dashboard to provide a richer and more intuitive user experience for interacting with the project's data and utilities. The current project includes a web interface for demographic data, and this proposal extends that concept to create a unified dashboard for all modules.

## 2. Problem Statement

The project currently relies on command-line tools for most operations, which can be cumbersome for users who are not familiar with the command line. A web-based dashboard would provide a more accessible and user-friendly interface for managing chat sessions, generating images, and analyzing data.

## 3. Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is to create a web-based dashboard that provides a graphical user interface for the following features:

*   **Chat Management:** A web-based chat interface that allows users to create, view, and manage chat sessions without having to directly edit JSON files.
*   **Image Generation:** A form-based interface for generating images with DALL-E, allowing users to specify prompts and other parameters.
*   **Data Visualization:** An interactive dashboard for visualizing demographic data, Steam library analysis, and other data generated by the project.
*   **Configuration:** A web-based interface for configuring API keys and other project settings.

## 4. Benefits

*   **Improved User Experience:** A web-based dashboard would provide a more intuitive and user-friendly interface for interacting with the project's features.
*   **Increased Accessibility:** A web-based interface would make the project accessible to a wider range of users, including those who are not comfortable with the command line.
*   **Centralized Management:** A unified dashboard would provide a centralized location for managing all aspects of the project.

## 5. Implementation Details

The dashboard could be built using a modern web framework such as React, Vue, or Svelte. The backend would be a Node.js server that interacts with the existing TypeScript modules. The existing web server for the demographics module could be extended to serve the new dashboard.
