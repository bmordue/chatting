This technique is commonly known as \"fixed tripod\" or \"single-exposure\" astrophotography. In this method, a camera is mounted on a sturdy tripod and an exposure is taken of the night sky without any tracking or movement. This technique can capture wide-angle shots of the stars, constellations, or landscapes with the night sky as a backdrop. However, it is not suitable for capturing detailed images of deep-sky objects like galaxies or nebulae."}]
