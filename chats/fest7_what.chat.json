It might refer to a specific festival or an event planning organization, but without further context, it is difficult to provide a precise answer.\n\nThe \"What now?\" app is a hypothetical app mentioned in your question. It could refer to an application designed to suggest activities or options for individuals after they have attended a show or an event. The purpose of such an app might be to provide recommendations for nearby restaurants, nightlife venues, attractions, or other entertainment options.\n\nHowever, please note that the \"What now?\" app does not exist in reality as described in your question, so any further details or specific functionalities would be speculative."
