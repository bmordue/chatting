    "content": "Yes, there are semacode t-shirts available on the market. Semacode is a type of two-dimensional barcode that can be scanned by mobile devices to access information or websites. These barcodes are often printed on various merchandise, including t-shirts. These t-shirts typically have a semacode printed on them, allowing others to scan the code and access the encoded information. However, it's worth noting that the popularity of semacodes has decreased over the years, so they may not be as commonly available as they once were."
