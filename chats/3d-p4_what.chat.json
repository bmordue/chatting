This means that the camera's components, casing, and other parts have been designed digitally and then manufactured layer by layer using a 3D printer. The resulting camera is typically custom-made and can be designed to fit specific requirements and preferences. 3D-printed cameras often offer a unique design and may be more affordable compared to traditional cameras."}]
