Your contact list and saved locations from Google Maps should synchronize automatically.\n- iOS Devices: Open the Settings app, scroll down and tap on \"Passwords & Accounts\" or \"Mail, Contacts, Calendars.\" Make sure your Google account is added and the Contacts toggle is enabled. The saved locations from Google Maps should sync with your contacts.\n\nNote that the process may vary depending on your device and version of operating system."
