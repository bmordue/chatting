    "content": "The Chrome extension \"Add Contact Directly from Search Results or Maps\" is a tool that allows users to easily add contact information to their address book or contacts list from search results or maps displayed on Google. With this extension, you can simply click on a contact's information (such as phone number, email address, or website) in your search results or on a map, and it will automatically create a new contact in your address book with that information. This eliminates the need to manually copy and paste the contact details into your contacts list, making it much more efficient and convenient."
