While PDF is the most commonly used format for CRS reports, you may also find some reports available in other formats such as EPUB (Electronic Publication). However, not all CRS reports are available in EPUB format. The availability of different formats may vary depending on the report and its publication date. You can check the official website of the Congressional Research Service (CRS) or other reputable sources to find specific reports or formats that are available. Additionally, some third-party platforms or databases may offer alternative formats for CRS reports."}]
