I will outline a specific image concept, and in response, you must produce an exhaustive, multifaceted prompt for Midjourney, ensuring every detail of the original concept is represented in your instructions. Midjourney doesn't do well with text, so after the prompt, give me instructions that I can use to create the titles in a image editor."

    "content": "Midjourney,\n\nLet's embark on a journey to a hauntingly beautiful realm. I urge you to generate an artwork heavily influenced by the unique visual style of Studio Ghibli. It must capture both the mystique and the animate, evocative expressiveness that defines this beloved anime. \n\nPlease begin by outlining a grand castle. This should keep with the traditional Ghibli-styled architecture, looking ancient yet full of character, imbued with an almost living personality. Position this castle to the left-hand side of the image, in such a manner that part of it seems to dissolve into the background, blurred by distance and atmospheric ambiance.\n\nNext, stage this landscape by the edge of a vast sea. The sea should occupy the lower third of the canvas, its inky darkness broken only by the shimmering, silver moonlight dancing on its rippling surface. Pay attention to beautifully detailed, realistic waves, their edges frosted with white as they break and tumble onto rocky waterfront. \n\nAbove all should be the celestial ballet, the moon stealing the spotlight, resolute and iridescent amongst the star-studded canvas. Its gentle light should not only mellow the castle but also lend the ocean an ethereal glow. Despite this radiant orb in the sky, the overall atmosphere of the scene should be slightly eerie, with hints of inky darkness creeping at the edges and shadows snaking around the castle's architectural marvels.\n\nTo bolster the mystique, drape a foggy veil which will bring the chilly air of mystery and eeriness. Play around with softer, muted colors and hues steeped in blue, purple, and gray with shadowy overtones and barely-there highlights of pallid yellow and silver.\n\nLastly, don't forget to sprinkle the scene with whispers of life: a lonely seagull flying, a light flickering somewhere in the castle, and perhaps the unknown nestled in the sea's dark depths, making us realize that every bit of this scene buzzes with its own story, unseen yet palpable.\n\n---\n\nFor the title creation in an image editor, follow these instructions:\n\n1. Use the ‘Text’ feature or equivalent to create a new text layer. \n2. Type the title: \"Dance of Moonlight and Shadows\".\n3. Opt for a typography that fits the artistry of Studio Ghibli, ideally something straightforward but stylish, carrying an artistic flair. \n4. Position the title at the bottom-center of the image.\n5. Implement a color for the title that complements the overall color palette, considering a dark blue or purple to match the nighttime hues with a soft, subtle white glow to give it an ethereal touch.\n6. Adjust the opacity of the text to blend it well with the image without obscuring its visibility."
