However, the availability of this feature may vary depending on the music player or streaming service you are using. Some platforms or applications allow users to create custom playlists with specific time signatures or tempo, while others may not have this specific feature.\n\nIf your music player or streaming service supports creating custom playlists based on time signature, you can search for songs in the 3-4 time signature and add them to a playlist. Some platforms may even have a pre-defined collection of songs in specific time signatures that you can choose from.\n\nHowever, if your music player or streaming service does not have this feature, you may need to manually search for songs in 3-4 time signature and create a playlist yourself by adding those songs to it. You can use a music analysis software or website to find the time signature of songs if you're unsure about their time signature.\n\nRemember that the availability of creating a smart playlist in a specific time signature will depend on the features provided by your chosen music player or streaming service."}]
