[{"role":"user","content":"what is  HOTOSM tasking manager: stats?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"The HOTOSM (Humanitarian OpenStreetMap) Tasking Manager is a web-based mapping tool that allows users to coordinate the mapping efforts of volunteers in response to various humanitarian and development projects. It is primarily used to organize tasks for mapping vulnerable or disaster-affected areas, but can also be used for mapping initiatives related to infrastructure development, public health, and other projects.\n\nHOTOSM Tasking Manager: Stats refers to the statistics or analytics provided by the tasking manager platform. These stats provide information about the progress and status of mapping tasks. They can include data on the number of tasks created, the number of tasks completed, the number of contributors involved, the amount of mapped area, and other relevant metrics. These statistics are useful for measuring the impact of volunteer mapping efforts, identifying areas that still need mapping attention, and tracking the overall progress of humanitarian and development projects."}]
