    "content": "There is no official \"UFOPedia\" rule set. However, \"UFOPedia\" is a term often used to refer to the in-game encyclopedia found in the popular strategy game series, X-COM. The UFOPedia in X-COM provides detailed information about aliens, equipment, and research options.\n\nIf you are looking for rule sets related to UFOs or aliens for a tabletop role-playing game or similar, there are various options available. Games like \"GURPS: UFOs\" or \"Conspiracy X\" offer rule sets specifically designed for playing games involving UFOs and extraterrestrial themes. Additionally, there are many fan-made homebrew rule sets available online, which can be customized to suit your preferences."
