These spreadsheets can be used to input the item, condition, and price of individual gadget components, such as an iPod HDD, and then compare the total value of those components to the price of the full gadget on eBay. Such spreadsheets can help you decide whether it is more beneficial to sell the components separately or as a whole gadget. You can find pre-made templates online or create your own using spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets."}]
