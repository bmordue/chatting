    "content": "Yes, there is a built-in feature in the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) Tasking Manager called \"Change Task Style when at 100%.\" This feature allows task managers to specify different styling or marking for tasks once they reach 100% completion.\n\nWhen a task is marked as 100% complete by mappers, the styling can change to indicate that it has been fully mapped. This change in style helps task managers easily identify tasks that are finished and ready for validation or review.\n\nThe specific implementation of this feature may vary depending on the version of the Tasking Manager being used, but it is a common functionality available in many deployments of HOT Tasking Manager."
