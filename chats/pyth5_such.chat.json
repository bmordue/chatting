These frameworks allow developers to build web applications using the Python programming language. Flask is a popular micro-framework that is lightweight and easy to get started with, while Pyramid is a more feature-rich framework that follows a component-based architecture. Both frameworks provide the necessary tools and libraries to develop web applications using Python."
