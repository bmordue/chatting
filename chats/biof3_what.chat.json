    "content": "Biofeedback audio for yoga refers to the use of audio recordings or guided meditation sessions that help individuals focus on their physiological responses, such as heart rate, breathing, and muscle tension. These recordings are designed to provide real-time feedback on these bodily functions, allowing practitioners to become more aware and in control of their physical and mental state during yoga practice. By listening to biofeedback audio, individuals can align their breathing patterns, regulate heart rate, and release muscle tension for a deeper and more effective yoga experience."
