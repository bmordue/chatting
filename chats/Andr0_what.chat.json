However, there are third-party apps available on the Google Play Store that can perform this function. These apps use reverse phone number lookup databases to identify and provide information about unknown callers. Some popular apps for this purpose include Truecaller, Whitepages Caller ID, and Hiya. Once installed, these apps can automatically identify and provide information about unknown calls received on your Android device."
