    "content": "DAVDroid is an open-source app that allows synchronization of calendars and contacts on Android devices with compatible server software. When it is mentioned that DAVDroid doesn't support \"well-known URLs,\" it means that the app does not have built-in compatibility to automatically discover server settings by accessing the well-known URLs associated with different services.\n\nWell-known URLs are specific paths on a server that are commonly used to provide basic configuration information. For example, the well-known URL for CalDAV calendars is \"/.well-known/caldav\". By accessing this URL, a CalDAV client can automatically discover the server's calendar configuration.\n\nIn the case of DAVDroid, it requires manual configuration of server settings like the URL and credentials to set up synchronization. It does not utilize well-known URLs to automatically retrieve this information from the server."
