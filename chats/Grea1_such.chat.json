It is a Greasemonkey script that adds sparklines to show the comment activity over time for each submission on the HN website. The sparklines give a graphical representation of how active the comment discussions have been for a particular submission. This tool can be found on the Greasy Fork website, which is a platform for user scripts compatible with various user script managers, including Greasemonkey."}]
