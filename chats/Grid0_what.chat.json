The image to be painted is divided into a grid, and each grid cell is assigned a number. The painter follows the provided paint-by-number instructions to fill in each grid cell with the corresponding color. The end result is a detailed and colorful image that is created one grid cell at a time. This technique is often used in paint by numbers kits, coloring books, or online painting applications."}]
