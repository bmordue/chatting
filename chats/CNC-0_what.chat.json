It involves using a computer program to control the movement of the machine's cutting tools, typically routers or mills, which carve out the desired design on the wooden panel.\n\nIn the context of a box or cabinet panel, a CNC-carved wooden relief can be a decorative element carved into the surface of the wood. It can consist of intricate patterns, motifs, or even detailed scenes that are raised from the wood, providing a visually appealing and tactile texture to the panel.\n\nWhen it comes to a landscape relief, it refers to a specific type of wooden relief that depicts a landscape scene. It could be a representation of mountains, forests, rivers, or any other natural elements carved into the wood to create a three-dimensional effect. This technique adds depth and realism to the wooden panel, giving the impression of a miniature landscape captured within the piece."}]
