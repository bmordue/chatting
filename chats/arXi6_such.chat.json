[{"role":"user","content":"is there such a thing as  arXiv <--> MNR abstracts \\\"reverse lookup\\\"?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No, there is no specific \"reverse lookup\" tool or functionality that directly connects arXiv (a repository of scientific papers) with MNR (the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, which publishes research articles in the field of astronomy and astrophysics). These platforms serve different purposes and have their independent databases.\n\nHowever, you can search for papers published in MNR that have corresponding entries in arXiv by using general search engines or databases that cover multiple scientific platforms. Many research articles are often submitted to arXiv before or simultaneously with traditional journals like MNR. Therefore, searching for the title or keywords of an MNR abstract on arXiv might provide you with preprints or articles related to that research."}]
