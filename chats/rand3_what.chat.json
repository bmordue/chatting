The specific details or functionalities of the app may vary, but typically it would have a feature to start Bluetooth connectivity.\n\nStarting Bluetooth connectivity in such an app usually involves a simple button or toggle switch within the app's user interface. When the user taps or activates this button, the app initiates a Bluetooth scan to discover nearby devices. Once a device is detected, the app establishes a Bluetooth connection, enabling the exchange of business card information.\n\nThe purpose of this app is to facilitate quick and efficient sharing of contact information between individuals in close proximity, without the need for physical business cards."}]
