    "content": "Yes, there is such a thing as public domain or Creative Commons (CC) licensed sports footage and speeches. Public domain refers to works that are not protected by copyright laws and can be freely used by anyone for any purpose without permission. CC licenses, on the other hand, allow creators to retain copyright but provide certain permissions to others to use their works under specific conditions.\n\nThere are various sources where you can find public domain or CC licensed sports footage, such as online archives, libraries, or specialized websites that offer free or open-license content. Some platforms like Wikimedia Commons (commons.wikimedia.org) and Pixabay (pixabay.com) provide a collection of public domain or CC licensed media files, including sports footage.\n\nAs for speeches, there are several websites that provide access to public domain or CC licensed speeches. The Internet Archive (archive.org) is a prominent platform that hosts a wide range of historical speeches, recordings, and other media files that may be in the public domain. Additionally, websites like Project Gutenberg (gutenberg.org) and Librivox (librivox.org) offer public domain literary works, including books with transcripts of speeches.\n\nDo note that while there are resources available, the specific footage or speech you are looking for may not always be in the public domain or available under a CC license. It is essential to check the licensing terms and requirements for each individual piece of content you wish to use."
