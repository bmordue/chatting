    "content": "Yes, there are certain Android apps available that can help you look up recent unknown callers automatically. These apps use reverse phone number lookup databases to identify the caller's information such as the name, location, and sometimes even social media profiles associated with the phone number. Some popular apps that offer this functionality include Truecaller, Caller ID & Number Locator, and Mr. Number. These apps can help you identify unknown callers and decide whether to answer the call or not."
