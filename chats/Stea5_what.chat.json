It serves as a reminder for users to buy games they want in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, Humble is a digital storefront that offers discounted deals on games and other digital content. It also supports various charity organizations by allowing users to choose a portion of their purchase to be donated. Humble has its own storefront, different from Steam.\n\nThere is no direct integration between Steam Wishlist and Humble. However, users can manually transfer games from their Steam Wishlist to their Humble account by searching for the desired game on the Humble storefront and making a purchase if it is available."}]
