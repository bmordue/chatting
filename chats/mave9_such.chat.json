One popular plugin is the Swagger Codegen plugin. This plugin allows you to specify your Swagger specification file and generate client code in various programming languages.\n\nTo use the Swagger Codegen plugin in your Maven project, you can add the following configuration to your project's pom.xml file:\n\n```xml\n<plugins>\n  <plugin>\n    <groupId>io.swagger</groupId>\n    <artifactId>swagger-codegen-maven-plugin</artifactId>\n    <version>2.4.17</version>\n    <executions>\n      <execution>\n        <goals>\n          <goal>generate</goal>\n        </goals>\n        <configuration>\n          <inputSpec>${project.build.directory}/swagger/swagger.yaml</inputSpec>\n          <language>java</language>\n          <output>${project.build.directory}/generated-sources/swagger</output>\n        </configuration>\n      </execution>\n    </executions>\n  </plugin>\n</plugins>\n```\n\nThis configuration specifies the Swagger specification file location, the desired language, and the output directory for the generated client code. You can customize these values according to your project's requirements.\n\nAfter configuring the plugin, you can run the `mvn generate-sources` command to invoke the plugin and generate the client code from Swagger at project build time."}]
