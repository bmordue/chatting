    "content": "AR, or Augmented Reality, for tabletop gaming refers to the integration of computer-generated images or virtual elements into the real-world environment of tabletop games. It enhances the gaming experience by combining physical elements, such as cards, dice, or miniature figures, with digital elements displayed on a screen or through a wearable device. This technology allows players to witness dynamic animations, interactive 3D models, additional game information, or even virtual opponents overlaid onto the game board or table. It can also enable multiplayer experiences, bringing distant players together in a shared augmented reality gaming environment."
