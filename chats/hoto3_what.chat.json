The term \"dashboard\" typically refers to a visual representation of data or information.\n\nIn the context of HOTOSM, a \"dashboard\" is a web-based interface that provides real-time information about the current users who are actively mapping or editing on the OSM platform. It may display the number of active users, their locations, the areas they are currently working on, and other relevant statistics. The dashboard helps to monitor the level of activity and engagement of the mapping community."}]
