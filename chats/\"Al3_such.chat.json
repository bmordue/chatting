Amazon provides an official Alexa Voice Service (AVS) SDK for Raspberry Pi, which allows developers to integrate Alexa into their own projects or devices. By installing and configuring the AVS software on a Raspberry Pi, you can create a voice-controlled assistant similar to Amazon Echo or Alexa-enabled devices."
