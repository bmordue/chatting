[{"role":"user","content":"is there such a thing as  python caldav?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, there is a Python package called `caldav` that allows developers to easily interact with CalDAV servers in Python. CalDAV is a standard protocol for accessing and managing calendar events over the HTTP protocol.\n\nThe `caldav` package provides a high-level interface to create, read, update, and delete calendar events on a remote CalDAV server using Python code. It also supports features like querying for events, adding attendees, and handling recurring events.\n\nYou can install `caldav` using pip:\n\n```\npip install caldav\n```\n\nOnce installed, you can then import and use it in your Python code:\n\n```python\nimport caldav\n\n# Connect to a CalDAV server\nclient = caldav.DAVClient(url=\"https://example.com/caldav\")\n\n# Get the calendar collection\nprincipal = client.principal()\ncalendars = principal.calendars()\n\n# Access a specific calendar\ncalendar = calendars[0]\n\n# Create a new event\nevent = calendar.save_event(\"Event Summary\", \"Event Description\",\n                            start='2022-01-01T09:00:00', end='2022-01-01T10:00:00')\n\n# Retrieve events from the calendar\nevents = calendar.events()\n\n# Print event summaries\nfor event in events:\n    print(event.summary)\n```\n\nThis is just a basic example of working with `caldav`. You can find more information and detailed documentation on how to use `caldav` in the official package documentation."}]
