    "content": "One of the easiest APIs you can use to get price distribution for an eBay keyword search is the eBay Finding API. Here are the basic steps to achieve this using the API:\n\n1. Obtain API Credentials: Register as an eBay developer and obtain the necessary API credentials, including the App ID (also known as the Client ID) required to authenticate your requests.\n\n2. Make a Request: Use the API endpoint `findCompletedItems` to search for completed eBay listings based on a keyword. Include additional parameters like `SortOrder` and `SoldItemsOnly` to filter the results and get completed/sold listings.\n\n3. Retrieve Price Data: Once you receive the response, you can extract the price information from the completed listing items. Each item will have a field like `sellingStatus.currentPrice` which provides the price of the item. Collect these prices for further analysis.\n\n4. Analyze Price Distribution: With the collected prices, you can calculate the price distribution using various statistical methods, such as grouping the prices into ranges or creating a histogram. Determine the frequency or density of prices at different intervals to get the distribution.\n\nRemember to carefully read the eBay Finding API documentation for detailed instructions on constructing the request, handling pagination, and correctly integrating the API into your application."
