        "content": "QGIS autoTrace is a plugin for the QGIS software that allows users to automatically convert raster images, such as scanned maps or satellite imagery, into vector format. The autoTrace plugin uses an algorithm to detect lines, boundaries, and other features in the raster image, and then creates corresponding vector objects, such as polygons, polylines, or points. This can be useful for digitizing and extracting features from raster data, enabling further analysis and editing in a vector-based environment."
