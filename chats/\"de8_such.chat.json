    "content": "Yes, there is a concept called Device Area Network (DAN) which refers to a wireless communication system specifically designed for connecting devices in an industrial or manufacturing environment. DAN is commonly used for large-scale computer numerical control (CNC) machines and other industrial automation systems.\n\nDAN is a type of wireless network that provides high-speed and reliable communication between devices within a limited area, typically a factory floor or production facility. It enables seamless connectivity and data exchange between various components of the CNC machine, such as the controller, sensors, actuators, and other peripheral devices.\n\nThe use of a wireless DAN in CNC machines offers several benefits, including increased mobility, flexibility, and scalability. It eliminates the need for physical wiring, simplifies device integration, reduces maintenance efforts, and allows for easier reconfiguration or expansion of the machine's setup.\n\nDifferent wireless communication protocols can be used to implement a DAN, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or even specialized industrial protocols like WirelessHART or ISA100.11a.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the specific implementation of a DAN can vary depending on the manufacturer or specific requirements of the CNC machine. However, the overall concept of utilizing a wireless communication network to connect and control devices in an extra-large CNC setup exists and is actively used in various industries."
