These tiles are designed to seamlessly integrate with a building's roof, providing both thermal insulation and solar water heating capabilities. They are usually made of durable materials such as glass, and they contain a network of small pipes through which water flows. The sun's energy heats up the water as it circulates through the pipes, providing an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution for water heating."}]
