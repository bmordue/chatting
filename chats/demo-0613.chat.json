I'd like you to review my design and point out any flaws or improvements that could be made. Please be as concise and succinct as possible. Here is the design to review:\nMain data structure:\n\n|Cohort lower bound|Cohort upper bound|Year|Size of cohort|\n\nSteps:\n1. Apply mortality for each cohort. Mortality is the likelihood of dying in a given year. Mortality is a function of age.\n2.Apply immigration and emigration for each mortality. Immigration increases size of a cohort. Emigration decreases the size of cohort. Both are a function of age.\n3. Apply birth rate for each cohort. Birth rate increases the size of the lowest cohort. Birth rate is a function of age.\n4. Incremement year. All simulated agents increase in age by one year.\n\nRepeat Steps 1-4 for as many years are required for the simulation."

        "content": "Overall, the design seems to be sound and logical. However, there are a few areas that could benefit from further clarification or improvement:\n\n1. Mortality: It would be helpful to define the specific function or formula used to calculate mortality based on age. This will ensure consistency and allow for easy replication of the model.\n\n2. Immigration and Emigration: Similar to mortality, it would be beneficial to have a clear explanation of the function or formula used to determine the impact of immigration and emigration on each cohort based on age. Additionally, it may be useful to consider other factors that could influence immigration and emigration rates.\n\n3. Birth Rate: Again, it would be helpful to specify the function or formula used to calculate the birth rate based on age. Additionally, you could consider incorporating other factors that may affect birth rates such as socioeconomic factors or cultural influences.\n\n4. Size of Cohort: It would be useful to define the specific parameters used to determine the initial size of each cohort. Additionally, considering the potential impact of cohort size on subsequent years could enhance the accuracy and realism of the model.\n\n5. Time Frame: Although it is mentioned in step 4, it would be helpful to explicitly state the intended time frame for the simulation. This will assist in understanding the long-term implications and trends that may arise from the model.\n\n6. Documentation: Consider providing comprehensive documentation that outlines the purpose, assumptions, and limitations of the model. This will enhance the usability and reproducibility of your demographic model.\n\nRemember to keep the design concise and succinct, providing clear explanations and specifications for each step in the process."
