[{"role":"user","content":"what is  mocha \\\"describe\\\" cannot have an empty/missing implementation??"},{"role":"assistant","content":"In Mocha (a JavaScript testing framework), the \"describe\" function is used to create a test suite. It is typically used to group related test cases together. \n\nThe \"describe\" function cannot have an empty or missing implementation, meaning it cannot be left blank without any test cases inside it. If the \"describe\" block is empty, Mocha will throw an error indicating that no tests were found. \n\nHere is an example of how \"describe\" is used with test cases inside it:\n\n```javascript\ndescribe(\"Math operations\", () => {\n  it(\"should correctly add two numbers\", () => {\n    // Test case code goes here\n  });\n\n  it(\"should correctly subtract two numbers\", () => {\n    // Test case code goes here\n  });\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, the \"describe\" block groups two test cases related to math operations. Each test case, defined using the \"it\" function, contains the actual code to be tested."}]
