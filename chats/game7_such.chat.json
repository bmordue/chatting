One such example is the Steam Workshop, which allows players to create, share, and download game scenarios, mods, and other custom content for various games on the Steam platform. Additionally, some game development tools and engines, such as Unity and Unreal Engine, have online communities and marketplaces where developers can share and sell game assets, including scenarios and pre-built levels, to be used in game servers."
