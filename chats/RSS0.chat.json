Once you have selected your preferred solution, you will usually need to authenticate your Instapaper account and choose the RSS feeds you want to subscribe to.\n\nOnce everything is set up, the RSS to Instapaper service will periodically check the selected RSS feeds for new articles. When it detects a new article, it automatically saves it to your Instapaper account. This means you can access the article later, either through the Instapaper website or mobile app.\n\nThis powerful integration between RSS feeds and Instapaper ensures that you have a curated reading list, tailored to your interests, waiting for you whenever you have the time to dive into it.
