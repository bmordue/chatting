These bots analyze the edit history of pages on a wiki and look for patterns or trends in the editing activity. If a page shows a decline in edits over time or has not been edited for a significant period, the bot identifies it as a potentially stale page. This helps maintain the quality and relevance of wiki content by flagging pages that may need review or updating."
