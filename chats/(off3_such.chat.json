These unique desks typically incorporate a hydroponic or aeroponic system that allows you to grow small plants such as microgreens right on your desk. The design usually includes special compartments or drawers equipped with LED lights, water reservoirs, and growing mediums, creating a self-contained mini indoor garden. This allows you to have fresh greens readily available while working in your office."
