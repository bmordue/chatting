Semacode is a two-dimensional barcode system that can store information such as website URLs, text messages, or contact details. Semacode jewellery typically involves embedding or engraving a semacode on a pendant, bracelet, ring, or other types of jewelry. The encoded information can be scanned using a mobile device's camera, allowing the wearer to share or access specific information."}]
