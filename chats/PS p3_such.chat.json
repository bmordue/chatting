Plugins like Nik Collection, Topaz Labs, or Adobe Camera Raw can be used to apply consistent color grading, tones, or other effects to your images within Photoshop. Additionally, using adjustment layers, layer styles, and layer masks in Photoshop can also help you create a consistent look for your triptych."
