The HOT Tasking Manager is an online platform where volunteers can collaborate and contribute to mapping projects. It allows users to assign tasks, track progress, and collect data. Within the tasking manager, there are statistics available for each project, including the number of tasks, mappers involved, completed tasks, and mapping progress. These statistics help project managers and contributors monitor the status and impact of their mapping projects."
