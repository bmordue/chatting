It's a fantastic tool that allows you to store and manage all your important contacts in one place. But wouldn't it be great if there was a way to quickly add contacts to Google Contacts without the hassle of manual input? Well, look no further because I've got just the solution for you - the hContact microformat Chrome extension!\n\nThe hContact microformat Chrome extension is a nifty little tool that makes it incredibly easy to send contacts directly to Google Contacts. But what exactly is a microformat, you may ask? Well, simply put, a microformat is a set of tags that can be embedded in HTML to describe certain types of information, in this case, contact details.\n\nWith this extension installed, all you need to do is find a web page containing a contact's information and then highlight the information you want to send. Once highlighted, simply right-click and select \"Send hContact to Google Contacts.\" Voila! The contact details will be automatically populated in the appropriate fields in Google Contacts.\n\nThis is particularly useful when you come across contact information on websites that aren't specifically designed to export their data to Google Contacts. Instead of manually copying and pasting each field, the hContact microformat extension streamlines the process, saving you time and effort.\n\nBut wait, that's not all! The extension also allows you to add multiple contacts at once. Simply highlight the contact details for all the individuals you want to add, right-click, and select \"Send hContact to Google Contacts\" just like before. Each individual's details will be added as separate contacts in Google Contacts, keeping your organization intact.\n\nNot only does this extension make adding contacts a breeze, but it also helps maintain consistency in your contact database. No more worrying about misspelled names, incorrect phone numbers, or missing email addresses. The hContact microformat ensures that all the necessary information is accurately captured and transferred to Google Contacts.\n\nSo, if you're tired of manually inputting contact details or dealing with clunky import/export processes, give the hContact microformat Chrome extension a try. It's a simple yet powerful tool that will revolutionize the way you add contacts to Google Contacts. Say goodbye to tedious data entry and hello to effortless organization!"
