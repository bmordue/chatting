    "content": "Yes, there is a way to convert a JHipster schema documentation to OpenAPI 3 format. You can use the Swagger Codegen tool to generate an OpenAPI spec from the JHipster schema documentation.\n\nHere are the steps to convert JHipster schema documentation to OpenAPI 3:\n\n1. Install Swagger Codegen:\n   - You can install Swagger Codegen using npm by running the following command in your terminal: `npm install -g swagger-codegen`\n\n2. Generate OpenAPI spec:\n   - Open the command prompt and navigate to the location where you have your JHipster schema documentation file.\n   - Run the following command to generate the OpenAPI spec using Swagger Codegen:\n     ```\n     swagger-codegen generate -i jhipster-schema.json -l openapi\n     ```\n\n3. The above command will generate the OpenAPI spec file in the current directory. You can use the generated OpenAPI spec file in your OpenAPI 3 documentation or tooling.\n\nPlease note that the above steps assume you have a valid JHipster schema documentation file named \"jhipster-schema.json\" in the same folder where you are running the Swagger Codegen command.\n\nMake sure to replace \"jhipster-schema.json\" with the actual filename and path of your JHipster schema documentation file."
