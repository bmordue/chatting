Sometimes, EPUB files include information about specific locations or places that can be considered as points of interest. These POIs may be mentioned within the text or embedded as metadata or hyperlinks.\n\nTo extract POIs from EPUBs, various techniques can be used. Here are some common methods:\n\n1. Text Processing: The EPUB file can be parsed and its text content can be analyzed using natural language processing techniques. Relevant keywords and phrases related to locations can be extracted, and further analysis can be performed to identify potential POIs.\n\n2. Metadata Extraction: EPUB files often include metadata that may contain location-specific details. Extracting and parsing the metadata can provide valuable information about POIs.\n\n3. Hyperlink Analysis: EPUB files may contain hyperlinks to external websites or resources. These hyperlinks can be scanned, and if they lead to location-specific content, the linked pages can be parsed to extract POIs.\n\nThe extracted POIs can then be used for various purposes, such as building location databases, geotagging content, or creating interactive maps within EPUB readers or applications."}]
