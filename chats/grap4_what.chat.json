    "content": "The graph of yoga pose transitions is a visual representation or chart that illustrates the flow of different yoga poses and how they move from one to another. It typically displays the sequence of poses with labeled arrows or lines indicating the direction or order in which they are performed. This graph helps yoga practitioners understand and memorize the flow of poses in a specific yoga sequence or practice. It can also be used as a reference guide for yoga instructors to create and design their own sequences."
