I will outline a specific image concept, and in response, you must produce an exhaustive, multifaceted prompt for Midjourney, ensuring every detail of the original concept is represented in your instructions. Midjourney doesn't do well with text, so after the prompt, give me instructions that I can use to create the titles in a image editor."

    "content": "Prompt for Midjourney:\n\n1. Description of the landscape:\n   - Start by creating a dark and mysterious atmosphere. The setting should be a desolate coastline, with rocky cliffs reaching towards the sea.\n   - Place a majestic castle on top of the cliffs, overlooking the ocean. The castle should appear old, with turrets and spires, reminiscent of Gothic architecture.\n   - The castle should be partially illuminated by a soft moonlight, casting eerie shadows on the surrounding landscape.\n   - Depict the sea below with foaming waves crashing against the rocks and reflecting the moonlight. The waves should be tumultuous, giving a sense of wildness and mystery.\n\n2. Detailed instructions for the castle:\n   - The castle should be the focal point of the composition. Make sure its size and position convey a sense of grandeur and dominance over the landscape.\n   - Add intricate details to the castle's architecture, such as ornate windows, steep roofs, and crumbling walls.\n   - The castle should have windows that emit a dim and warm light, casting an inviting glow against the night sky.\n   - Surround the castle with an aura of enchantment and fantasy. Incorporate magical elements like floating orbs or glowing will-o'-the-wisps to enhance the fantastical atmosphere.\n\n3. Moonlit atmosphere:\n   - The moon should be large, full, and luminous, taking up a significant portion of the night sky.\n   - Capture the moonlight reflecting on the surface of the waves, creating a shimmering and gentle glow. The reflection should stretch across the entire sea, leading towards the castle.\n   - Use subtle shades of blue and silver to depict the moonlight, enhancing the dreamlike ambiance.\n   - Add wispy clouds that partially obscure the moon, adding an element of mystery and drama to the scene.\n\n4. Studio Ghibli-inspired details:\n   - Incorporate the signature Studio Ghibli style by giving the landscape a hand-drawn appearance, as if it were a frame from an animated film.\n   - Use a combination of soft and gentle brush strokes to create a sense of ethereal beauty and emotional depth.\n   - Capture the essence of Studio Ghibli's attention to detail and organic forms by adding elements like lush vegetation, wildflowers, or whimsical creatures in the foreground or surrounding areas.\n   - Pay attention to soft lighting and shadows, giving the composition a touch of magic and wonder.\n\nInstructions for image editor:\n\n1. Title Text:\n   - Use a bold and slightly whimsical font for the title.\n   - Place the title at the top or bottom of the image, leaving enough space for it to be easily readable.\n   - Experiment with semi-transparent or glowing effects to enhance the mysterious atmosphere.\n   - Color the title in shades of blue or silver to match the moonlit scene.\n\n2. Subtitle Text:\n   - Use a more elegant and delicate font for the subtitle.\n   - Position the subtitle below the title, smaller in size but still legible.\n   - Apply a soft glow effect to the subtitle to make it stand out.\n   - Color the subtitle in a complementary color to the title, such as a light lavender or gray.\n\n3. Additional Effects:\n   - Experiment with adding a subtle vignette effect around the edges of the image to draw the viewer's focus towards the central composition.\n   - Add a slight blur to the foreground or outer edges of the image to create a sense of depth and to enhance the dreamlike quality.\n   - Apply a gentle film grain texture to give the final artwork a nostalgic and cinematic feel."
