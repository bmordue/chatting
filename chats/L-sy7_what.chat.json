[{"role":"user","content":"what is  L-system to create bespoke furniture (cf CityEngine...)?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"L-system, also known as Lindenmayer system, is a mathematical model used to describe the growth and development of plants. However, it can also be applied in computer graphics and design, including the creation of bespoke furniture.\n\nIn the context of creating bespoke furniture, L-systems can be used to generate complex and intricate patterns, shapes, and structures. CityEngine, a procedural modeling software, can utilize L-systems to generate 3D models of buildings and urban environments, but it can also be extended to furniture design.\n\nBy defining a set of rules and parameters, designers can use L-systems to create unique furniture forms and patterns. The rules determine how the structure grows and develops, resulting in various iterations and designs. Additionally, parameters can be adjusted to control the height, width, and other characteristics of the furniture.\n\nUsing L-systems in conjunction with CityEngine or other design software, designers can generate a range of furniture designs that can be further refined and customized. This approach allows for efficient exploration of design possibilities and facilitates the creation of bespoke furniture pieces tailored to specific preferences and requirements."}]
