[{"role":"user","content":"what is  Ff reader mode by default?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"FF Reader mode, or Firefox Reader View, is a built-in feature of the Firefox web browser. It allows users to view articles and other web content in a clutter-free, easy-to-read format. The Reader mode strips away unnecessary advertisements, navigation menus, and other distracting elements, providing a simplified reading experience. By default, this mode is not enabled automatically, but users can manually activate it by clicking on the book icon that appears in the address bar when they visit a web page with reader mode compatibility."}]
