These comments primarily aim to facilitate collaboration among developers by improving the understanding and readability of the code for others. Social code comments involve providing contextual information, explanations of design choices or intentions, documenting assumptions, highlighting potential pitfalls or trade-offs, and suggesting improvements or alternative approaches. They are considered a best practice in software development to enhance code maintainability, encourage knowledge sharing, and foster open communication within a development team."
