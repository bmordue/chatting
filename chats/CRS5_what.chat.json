[{"role":"user","content":"what is  CRS Report for Congress (Congressional Research Service) as epub instead of PDF??"},{"role":"assistant","content":"The Congressional Research Service (CRS) provides research reports and analysis to members of the United States Congress. These reports are typically available in PDF format on the CRS website or through various online sources. However, it is not common to find CRS reports in epub format.\n\nThe primary format for CRS reports is PDF because it preserves the layout and formatting of the original document. PDF also ensures that the content is viewable on different devices and platforms.\n\nIf you specifically require a CRS report in epub format, you may need to convert the PDF file to epub using third-party software or online converters. There are several tools available online that can convert PDF to epub format. However, keep in mind that the conversion process may not always preserve the exact formatting and layout of the original PDF, as epub is primarily designed for reflowable text on e-readers."}]
