If you have a music library with songs labeled by time signature, you can create a smart playlist that includes all the songs in 3/4 time. Here's how to do it using iTunes as an example:\n\n1. Open iTunes and go to the \"File\" menu.\n2. Select \"New\" and then \"Smart Playlist.\"\n3. In the first dropdown menu, choose \"Time\" and set it to \"is greater than\" or \"is equal to.\"\n4. In the second dropdown menu, type \"3/4.\"\n5. Click the \"+\" button at the right end of the row to add another rule.\n6. In the second row, select \"Time\" again and set it to \"is less than\" or \"is equal to.\"\n7. In the text field next to it, type \"4/4.\"\n8. Optionally, you can add more rules to further refine the playlist if needed.\n9. Click \"OK\" to save the smart playlist and name it accordingly.\n\nThis smart playlist will continuously update itself and show all the songs in your music library that have a time signature ranging from 3/4 to 4/4."
