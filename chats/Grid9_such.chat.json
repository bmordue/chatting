Grid-based paint by numbers involves dividing a painting or image into a grid and assigning each grid section a specific color or number. Then, individuals can paint each grid section according to the corresponding color or number given. This method helps break down complex images into manageable sections, making it easier for people to recreate the image accurately. Grid-based paint by numbers kits and online tools are available for this purpose."}]
