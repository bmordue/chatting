MapSwipe is a mobile application used to identify areas in satellite imagery that require mapping, while HOT TM2 is a web-based platform that coordinates and manages mapping tasks for humanitarian projects. The two platforms can be linked together to ensure a smoother workflow in the mapping process. MapSwipe helps prioritize certain areas for mapping, and the results can be integrated into HOT TM2 as tasks to be completed by mappers using the TM2 interface. This way, the efforts and contributions from MapSwipe users can be utilized effectively within the HOT TM2 project."
