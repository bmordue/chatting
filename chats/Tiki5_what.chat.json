Tiki is a Polynesian term representing mythological and ancestral figures often portrayed as totemic carvings. Tiki wood printing blocks are traditionally carved from different types of wood, including native hardwoods such as koa, mahogany, or monkey pod. These blocks are meticulously carved with intricate patterns, symbols, and figures associated with Tiki culture. They are used primarily in printmaking or fabric printing to transfer the carved designs onto paper or textiles. Tiki wood printing blocks are valued for their unique craftsmanship and cultural significance, reflecting the rich traditions of Polynesian art."
