'devs who starred this also starred...'?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes, there is a feature on GitHub called \"Contributors\" and \"Stargazers\" that can provide you with information about developers who have worked on a particular project or have starred it.\n\nOn a GitHub project page, you can click on the \"Contributors\" tab to see a list of all the developers who have contributed to that project. This includes both the project's authors and people who have made contributions in the form of pull requests, bug fixes, etc. This can give you an idea of who has worked on the project and their level of involvement.\n\nSimilarly, by clicking on the \"Stargazers\" tab, you can see a list of users who have starred the project. Starring a project on GitHub is a way for users to bookmark or show appreciation for a project they find interesting or useful. The \"Stargazers\" list can give you an idea of who else in the GitHub community finds the project appealing.\n\nKeep in mind that the availability of these lists depends on whether the project owners have made them public. Some project owners may choose to keep the contributors and stargazers lists private."}]
