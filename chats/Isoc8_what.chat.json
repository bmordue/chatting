Isochrones are distance-based visual representations that show areas that can be reached within a given time frame from a specific location. For example, an isochrone map can display the areas that can be reached within a 30-minute drive from a person's residence. This information can be useful for various purposes, such as planning commuting routes, determining service areas, or analyzing accessibility to certain amenities or facilities."}]
