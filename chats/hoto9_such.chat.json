However, as of my last knowledge update, there is no specific \"hotosm: dashboard\" that displays the current users online. However, HOTOSM (Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team) does have a platform called \"Tasking Manager,\" which allows users to coordinate mapping tasks for humanitarian projects. While it provides information about users involved in mapping projects, it does not specifically show who is online at any given moment."
