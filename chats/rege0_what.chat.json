[{"role":"user","content":"what is  regex to multiple google searches?"},{"role":"assistant","content":"To perform multiple Google searches using regex, you can programmatically iterate through a list of search queries and create the respective search URLs. However, it is important to note that scraping Google search results may violate their terms of service, so make sure to comply with their policies or consider using official search APIs.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use regex in Python to create Google search URLs for multiple queries:\n\n```python\nimport re\nimport urllib.parse\n\nqueries = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\"]\n\nfor query in queries:\n    # Remove leading/trailing spaces and replace spaces with '+'\n    query = re.sub('\\s+', '+', query.strip())\n    \n    # Construct the Google search URL\n    search_url = f\"https://www.google.com/search?q={urllib.parse.quote(query)}\"\n    print(search_url)\n```\n\nThis code will generate the following search URLs for the given queries:\n\n```\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=apple\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=orange\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=banana\n```\n\nYou can then use these URLs to perform the actual searches or extract information from the search results, depending on your specific use case."}]
