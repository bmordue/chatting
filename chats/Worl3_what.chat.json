Identify the key events or periods you want to include in your chart, such as important historical periods, significant events, or influential figures.\n\n2. Access the Wikidata website (www.wikidata.org), which is the centralized database that collects structured data used by Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects.\n\n3. Use the search bar on the Wikidata website to find items related to your chosen historical events or figures. For example, if you want to include the Renaissance period, search for \"Renaissance\" and select the corresponding item.\n\n4. On the Wikidata item page, you will find various pieces of structured information, such as the start date, end date, and other relevant details. Note down the required information for your chart, including the item label, start date, and end date.\n\n5. Repeat the above steps for each historical event or figure you want to include, and compile the information in a spreadsheet or document.\n\n6. Organize the information in a timeline format, arranging events chronologically from left to right. Include the item labels and corresponding start and end dates for each event or period.\n\n7. Design your wall chart using any graphic design software or even a simple word processor. You can create columns or rows for different centuries, decades, or years, and label them accordingly.\n\n8. Input the information from your compiled list into the appropriate places on your chart. Ensure that items with overlapping dates are neatly arranged to avoid confusion.\n\n9. Enhance your wall chart with additional relevant details, such as key figures, important milestones, or any other information you find relevant.\n\n10. Once you're satisfied with the design, print your chart on a large sheet of paper suitable for display on a wall.\n\nBy following these steps, you can create a visually appealing and informative World history wall chart using data sourced from Wikidata."
